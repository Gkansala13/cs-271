# Use this assembler program to convert .asm files into .hack files, 
# just run the program, you will be prompted with "input filepath" in the command line
# then just copy and paste the filepath in. 
# After the program creates a new hack file, go into your default assembler program
# that is saved in the nand2tetris tools folder. 
# Input the original asm file and compare it with your newly created hack file.
# The results should be identical.
# I am just now looking at the grading criteria... I didn't realize 
# we were supposed to be logging our progress on github. I can try
# and redo my steps if you need me to, but I do not have enough time to do that tonight. 
# For my code I essentially put code, symbolTable dictionaries inside my parser. And made my assembeler work as the main.
# With that, everything should be working as it should, thanks for the great term. 
# I also added some comments to help with the readabilty of the program
